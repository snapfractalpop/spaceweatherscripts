These scripts are meant to query NOAA data that is in the public domain and is accessible via website.

get-xray-flux:

This script uses wget to fetch and parse current X-Ray flux levels.

It takes no arguments.

It returns the current X-Ray flux (wavelengths: 1e-10m - 8e-10m) in watts / (meter ^ 2), as measured by the GOES-15 satellite.
More details about data source below.

Goals:

To build an alert system and use cron to periodically monitor solar activity.
