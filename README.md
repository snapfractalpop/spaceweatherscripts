Description:
------------

These scripts are meant to query NOAA data that is in the public domain and is accessible via website.

**send-alert**:

This script will conditionally send email alerts to addresses specified under the alias flare_alert_group.
It can be placed in cron to run every minute. It will not send more than one alert per hour.

It takes no arguments.

**get-xray-flux**:

This script uses wget to fetch and parse current X-Ray flux levels.

It takes no arguments.

It returns the current X-Ray flux (wavelengths: 1e-10m - 8e-10m) in watts / (meter ^ 2), as measured by the GOES-15 satellite.
More details about data source below.

Installation instructions (for Linux):
======================================

With sendmail/postfix installed, add an alias to $HOME/.mailrc (create that file if necessary) called flare_alert_group and add subscribers email addresses, comma separated like so:

<pre>
alias flare_alert_group subscriber1@example.com,subscriber2@example.com
</pre>

You can also add cell phone numbers so that subscribers receive text messages:

- Verizon: {10 digit cell number}@vtext.com
- Sprint: {10 digit cell number}@messaging.sprintpcs.com
- AT&T: {10 digit cell number}@txt.att.net

Add send-alert script to $HOME/bin (create directory if necessary)

Run crontab -e and add the following entry:

<pre>
# m h dom mon dow command
* * * * * /home/ubuntu/bin/send-alert
</pre>

*Note*:
This script will create a small file (a few bytes) in $HOME called .lastAlert which is used to keep a timestamp of when the last alert was sent. It is needed in order to prevent the sending of too many alerts in the duration of an x-class flare event. This file name/location can be changed in the script (in case of namespace collision).

Goals:
------

To build an alert system and use cron to periodically monitor solar activity.
